Introduction
============

These R scripts were developed to facilitate to 
Microarray analysis. A lot of R packages and code
could be found to perform microarray analysis. 
But every time I have rewrite the script to adapt 
different task. To address the lack of stable R 
scipts, I present this suit, for identifiying 
differentially expressed genes. This suit could 
accomplish mission automatically. All I should do 
is to design the comparison, make the txt file and
name it with the GSE id.

Key words: MAS5.0, limma, microarray. 


Install & Preperation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just download the suit and make sure that R was 
avaliable in your OS. Meanwhile, make sure you 
install all the following packages:

GEOquery
limma
affy
hgu133plus2cdf
hgu133plus2hsentrezgcdf
org.Hs.eg.db
hgu133plus2.db

To install a particular package, type the 
following in an R command window:

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(your package)

But there is one exception:
The latest version of hgu133plus2hsentrezgcdf was downloaded from brainarray. See the url below:
http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/CDF_download.asp



Usage of this suit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just type the following command in the terminal:
Rscript pipeline.R GSE10437.txt

pipeline.R is the main script of this suit.
GSE10437.txt is the name of the target file in our analysis.
The content of this file should be:

Name	FileName	Condition
M0h	GSM263933.CEL	0h
T0h	GSM263934.CEL	0h
M18h	GSM263935.CEL	18h
T18h	GSM263936.CEL	18h


Content of the result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All these results found in the folder GSE10437 contains:

1) microarray list in txt format
2) raw cel files
3) QC reports in pdf
4) mas5 matrix
5) differentially expressed gene list
6) heatmap of differential gene
7) gene set enrichment analysis (kegg & go)
8) chromosome distribution
